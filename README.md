# CaesarCipher
Encyrption and Decryption Program made with Python 3.7.2
This project was made as a final project for my 2019SP Fnds Cybersecurity/Forensics (ITI-2380-01) class. 
The idea was to create a program that would encrypt a plaintext, and then to create a program that would decrypt the ciphertext.
